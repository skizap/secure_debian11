# HOW TO RUN THE SECURE_DEBIAN11.SH SCRIPT

1. Install dos2unix
   ----------------
   Sometimes your script might include Windows-style carriage returns (\r),
   which can cause errors. To remove these, install dos2unix:

       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get install -y dos2unix

2. Convert the Script to Unix Format
   ----------------------------------
   Use dos2unix on the script to ensure it has the correct line endings:

       dos2unix secure_debian11.sh

3. Make the Script Executable
   ---------------------------
   Change the script permissions to make it executable:

       chmod +x secure_debian11.sh

4. Run the Script with Bash
   -------------------------
   Since the script uses 'set -euo pipefail' and other Bash-specific features,
   you must run it with Bash:

       sudo bash secure_debian11.sh

   Make sure you are root or have sudo privileges when running the script.

5. Verify the Process
   -------------------
   The script should:
     - Update and upgrade your system
     - Enable unattended upgrades
     - Create a new sudo user
     - Install and configure UFW
     - Install and configure Fail2Ban
     - Create a 6GB swap file
     - Install and configure ClamAV
     - Provide final notes about system maintenance

6. Troubleshooting
   ---------------
   - If you still see errors like '$\r: command not found':
        - Make sure you've run 'dos2unix secure_debian11.sh'.
        - Open the script with 'nano' or 'vi' and confirm file format is "Unix (LF)".
   - If you see 'Please run this script as root':
        - Use 'sudo su' or run 'sudo bash secure_debian11.sh'.

7. Enjoy Your Hardened Debian System!
   -----------------------------------
   After running this script, your Debian 11 system should be more secure,
   with a basic firewall (UFW), Fail2Ban, automatic updates, and a malware
   scanner installed.
